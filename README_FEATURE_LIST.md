# Feature list

Go-dom is still in a very early stage. This is a brief list of supported
features (which may be outdated because I forgot to update it)

Overall, the browser can parse the DOM and execute scripts, but has a very
limited DOM

**Do NOT expect a feature to work if not explicitly mentioned here**

## TLDR

What currently works:

- Start a browser, directly on top of an `http.Handler`
- Load a page using HTMX (you have to supply the assets from the handler, no CDN)
- Find and click elements, calling `Element.Click()`. If the element has an `hx-get`, the request will be made
  - Other verbs should work too, but not tested.
- Click a link, and it will navigate (new script context)
- Click an hx-boosted link, and HTMX will navigate, i.e., push to the history, but not refres, and keep the script context
- Form support
  - Submit a vanilla form, 
    - Note: Redirects are not followed yet.
  - Submit a form with `hx-post`, HTMX behaviour will work (i.e., swapping in the form)
    - Other verbs should work too, but not tested.
  - The only `<input>` types that are tested are `text` and `submit` (for submitting)
  - No keyboard simulation, set the value using `element.SetAttribute("value", "foo")`
- Cookies
- `setTimeout`, but with disregard to the actual timeout, scripts will be enqueued for immediate execution.
  - This is _just enough_ to get base HTMX flow working

## Handling of `<script>`

Go-dom supports blocking script execution; both inline, and downloaded. There is
no support for `async` and `defer` attributes; such scripts are still blocking.

ES modules are NOT supported yet. 

See also: [Script engines](./README_SCRIPT_ENGINE.md)

### execution

Scripts are executed while _during_ DOM construction as it should, But the
entire response body has already been processed, so implementing
`document.write` wouldn't be possible without a complete rewrite of the HTML
parser.

> created.

## Content loading

- Opening a window returns an error if the server response with a non-200 status
  code.
- Redirects are not followed.

Note: The result can still be used when there is a bad HTTP status code. But
there is no differentiation between a network error, and an HTTP status error.

## DOM in general

- `Element.outerHTML` and `innerHTML` - works, but output is not escaped.

### No namespace support

There is no support for namespaces. While the document has a `CreateElementNS`,
that is so far _only_ implemented to prevent SVG elements from being constructed
as HTML elements. Other `...NS` functions do not exist, neither the ability to
query namespaces.

## HTML Elements

All elements have the correct class in JavaScript code, but not all element
behaviours are implemented. In general, if a type exists for an element in the
`html` package, some behaviour specific to that element is implemented.

### Forms

There is simple form support, 

- Calling `click()` on an `<input type="submit">` or `<button type="submit">`
submits the form.
- Attributes on the submitter does not override the form's method/action.
- To set a input field, you must set the `value` attribute. There is no support
for keyboard input simulation.
- Reset behaviour is not implemented!

### Other elements

- `<a>` navigates to a new pages when calling `click()`.
- `<template>` has a `content` attribute containing a fragment where the HTML
child nodes are found.

## XHR, no fetch

There is an XHR implementation. It doesn't support all events yet. `send(body)`
only accepts a `FormBody`.

Fetch is not supported but you can add a polyfill to your project if you need
fetch, or you could make a PR:

- Go code to install polyfills: https://github.com/stroiman/go-dom/blob/main/browser/scripting/v8host/polyfills.go 
- Folder for javascript files to load: https://github.com/stroiman/go-dom/tree/main/browser/scripting/v8host/polyfills
